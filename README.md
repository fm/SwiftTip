# SwiftTip
My first Swift app. A simple, minimalistic tip calculator.  
In collaboration with Justin Lauffer. 

There's two versions of the app. 

**v1 (currently master)** - original design, uses segmentedControls for number of guests and tip amounts.   
**v2** - new design, uses a stepper number of guests, will be more condensed towards the top 
probably will be merged into master at some point when it's more stable and the design is more concrete.   

*Many thanks to:*  
Harrison Weinerman  
Eytan Schulman  
and Jaden Geller for their advice and help while building the app
